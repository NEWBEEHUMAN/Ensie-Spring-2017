## Introduction

Ensie is an online encyclopedia used by lawyers, students, doctors, businessmanagers and professors. 
Ensie was founded on the unique principle of authorship: the source of the information is visible for everyone. 
The LinkedIn profile of the expert is connected to the described subjects. 
This increases the trustworthiness of the platform and ensures that it is always exactly clear where the information came from.

### Ensie education

While we are improving our online platform every day we want to add an extra future so Ensie can be easy used as an education tool. 
Therefore we would like to develop a system where professors can make changes in a text, track changes and add their feedback.

Besides we would like to develop a wordpress plugin to make it easy for writers to integrate published articles easily on their website.

### Development

Ensie already have a system and our goal is to improve it. This is what needs to be added:
1. Posting manually an articles.
2. Sharing configuration.
3. Followers and friends network.
4. Messanging and commenting.
4. Wordpress plugin to share an article from Ensie on private website.


### Technology

Ensie has a web application which is using plain JS and jQuery on the client-side PHP on the server-side and MySQL as a database.
